# Database Creation Process and Machine Learning Model Development with Streamlit

In this document, we will discuss the process of creating a database, including understanding attributes, entities, cardinality, table creation, and data analysis queries. Later on, we will address data export for machine learning model development and the creation of a deployment model using Streamlit.

Database Creation Process

1. Understanding Attributes and Entities
Example: In an entity "Customer," attributes may include name, age, email, etc.

2. Entities: Real-world objects represented in the database. Example: "Customer," "Product," "Sale," etc.

3. Cardinality: Defines the number of instances of an entity that can be associated with instances of another entity. Example: "one to one," "one to many," "many to many."

4. Table Creation using a database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLServer, among others, we will create tables to store data according to identified entities and their attributes.

5. Data Analysis Queries We will use SQL queries to extract useful information from the database, such as statistics, trends, and patterns.

# Data Export for Machine Learning Development
After creating and analyzing the data, we can export it for machine learning model development. The steps include:

1. Data Extraction: Exporting the data from the database to a suitable format for analysis, such as CSV, JSON, or directly to Python data structures.

2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, filling in missing values, normalizing or standardizing the data, and performing other necessary transformations to prepare the data for modeling.

3. Data Splitting: Separating the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

4. Machine Learning Model Development: Using libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch to build and train machine learning models.

# Streamlit Deployment Model

Streamlit is a Python library for creating web applications for data analysis and machine learning quickly and easily. To create a deployment model in Streamlit, the steps may include:

1. Application Development: Write the Streamlit application code, which includes defining the user interface and integrating with the machine learning model.

2. Application Deployment: Use hosting platforms such as Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform to deploy the application.

3. Testing and Maintenance: Test the deployed application to ensure its proper functioning and perform maintenance as necessary."
